    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>John Gruber at DaringFireball quickly <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/06/18/grobart-ipad">points out</a> the logical error in Sam Grobart&rsquo;s <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/microsofts-not-competing-with-the-ipadnot-entirely/">justification</a> why he is not getting the iPad.</p>

<blockquote><p>There’s a significant population out there, people who look at an iPad and say, “I like it, but can I get one to replace my laptop? Even for just some of the time?” And the honest answer has always been, “No.” The iPad has plenty of accessories, but it’s not a productivity device.</p></blockquote>

<p>There might be a bit of sensationalism there, but here is something to consider. There are many first gen iPad owners out there, like me, whom are not exactly blown away by <strong>the new iPad</strong>, but want to replace this old piece of thing with something new.</p>

<p>I would have eventually gave in and would bought the iPad 3, but now I will just wait and see!</p>
