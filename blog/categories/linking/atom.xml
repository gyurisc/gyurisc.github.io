Work backwards. Come up with a brand name. Start designing a website, then actually launch a website and start blogging about your journey. Build backlinks, work on SEO, build a personal brand, establish yourself as an expert, make connections, speak at conferences… It&rsquo;s not the lack of ideas that holds you back; it&rsquo;s procrastination.</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>Indiehackers <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/jitbit-software">https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/jitbit-software</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

She visited a large fraction of Digital&rsquo;s engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks. During many of her lectures, she illustrated a nanosecond using salvaged obsolete Bell System 25 pair telephone cable, cut it to 11.8 inch (30 cm) lengths, the distance that light travels in one nanosecond, and handed out the individual wires to her listeners. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper</a> Grace Hopper</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Grace Hopper invented the compiler and coined the term debugging. The two things I do in most of my professional life. She must be a truly remarkable person and I owe her my job! :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>What does this sound like? Yes, it’s a textbook case of a protection racket. It is organized crime, plain and simple.

When you pay up, you’re funding the criminals, which makes you complicit in their next attacks. I know, you’re just trying to write a little app for the iPhone with in-app purchases, and you didn’t ask for this fight to be yours, but if you pay the trolls, giving them money and comfort to go after the next round of indie developers, you’re not just being “pragmatic,” you have actually gone over to the dark side.

<p>I think the last sentence is classic and I fully agree with it. Life is a bit hard sometimes, and sometimes you have to step up and fight fights that you never signed up for.</p>

<p>There are some very awfull software patents granted in the past and there are some, who are clearly abusing this system. Let&rsquo;s stop these trolls together!</p>
