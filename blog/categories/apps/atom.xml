    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{% blockquote triggerio <a href="http://trigger.io/cross-platform-application-development-blog/2013/01/29/trend-towards-the-mass-customization-of-apps-from-banking-to-government-to-entertainment/">http://trigger.io/cross-platform-application-development-blog/2013/01/29/trend-towards-the-mass-customization-of-apps-from-banking-to-government-to-entertainment/</a> Trend towards the Mass Customization of Apps from Banking to Government to Entertainment %}</p>

<p>But in the past couple of months we’ve noticed another category of customers, and that group is growing fast.</p>

<p>I call the trend the “mass customization” of apps, to borrow the manufacturing term. This group creates app templates designed for a particular industry and then customize those templates for each end customer. The customization could be as simple as different branding but more often includes adding differentiating features also.
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>This article is a total eye-opener for me. With this trend, non-native apps (HTML-CSS-JS have now an edge over native mobile apps. The common source code base. With this common code-base, you can provide customizable apps that can be built and packaged from a web page and deployed much faster. Obviously, you will not build cutting edge racing games or first person shooters in html, but it does not matter. You can build awesome apps to large customers on all platform using the same codebase.</p>

<p>This is totally awesome!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems I am unable to count to 5. In my last blog <a href="http://www.littlebigtomatoes.com/2013/01/5-ways-to-get-better-at-designing-apps-for-windows-phone/">5 ways to get better at designing apps for Windows Phone</a> I promised 5 ways and I delivered only four. This is the follow up, where I try to give one last piece of advice.</p>

<h2>Write apps for yourself</h2>

<p>You need to scratch your own itch. You need to solve your own existing problem, so find something you truly miss from your phone and then solve it! This way you will have an app that make your life better. Also, you will use this app every single day, so bugs and problems with your app surface much quicker and it will be easier to fix them as you are the one, who designed and coded it. But be very careful&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Do not write apps that no one will use&hellip;</h2>

<p>I am guilty as charged. I had this idea of <a href="www.hotbidd.com/apps/emailme">sending emails to myself</a> and wrote the app. It took me three months of hard work and when I finally released it, there were only a few downloads. This is not the end of the world, because I use the app myself several times a day and learned lot of stuff, while designing and coding it! But when I started to promote my app, no-one seemed to understand what problem of theirs that my app will help to solve.</p>

<p>I found a solution to a problem, that seemingly no other person on earth had. Frustrating, but the key lesson I learned is this - similar to designing your app - you should start promoting your app, before you start coding it! Go out and explain the idea behind your app and the problem it tries to solve. Find out that others are having this problem too and pitch your app to them. Embrace the feedback and in the end you will have a much better app. Learn from my mistake and do not create your app in vacuum&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am constantly trying to improve the quality of apps that I am publishing on the market for Windows Phone and Windows 8 or to other platforms in the future. In the last couple of days I try to think ways how I can get better at designing and creating apps. My primary device at the moment is a Lumia 800 and my primary desktop OS is Windows 8. These are not the dominant platforms yet, but I am hoping they get more popular over time.</p>

<h2>Buy an iPod Touch</h2>

<p> If you try to sense what is the golden standard of apps on today&rsquo;s prime platforms in terms of speed, design or popularity you really need something that you can try these apps on. Cheapest and best is to buy a used iPod Touch. This way you will feel what are the popular todo apps doing in the productivity category, if you are planning to write one for Windows Phone. Once you have the device, try as many apps as you can. Feel the speed and the attention to details that went into the app. Feel the love that went into the app. This is the quality you should aim for with your apps too!</p>

<p> For extra kudos buy a cheap android phone or tablet or both if you have the money. This is money well spent as you can start writing apps for those devices as well.</p>

<h2>Say no to the cookie cutter approach</h2>

<p> You have an app idea that will rock the world and make you rich. You need to move fast. Launch Visual Studio and quickly create a new project using the pivot app template. Code like crazy. Test, Test, Test and upload to the market place.</p>

<p> Just slow down for a second. This is how you create an app that does nothing to differentiate itself from the tens of thousands of other apps that are already on the marketplace. There must be a better way to differentiate it. Think about using different colors than the system accent color.</p>

<p>I know that the metro design guidelines are saying that we need to honor the user&rsquo;s choice of accent color and theme, but honestly as a user I need to puke when I see one more cookie cutter pivot style app that looks like all the other apps on my phone. I need opinionated apps! I need apps that stands out and they have personality!</p>

<h2>Animation, Animation, Animation</h2>

<p>Same here with the default controls. Pivot was great two years ago and remains very useful today, but now it feels a little tired to me. If you have an idea just to spice up a little the pivot the it is great. If you can come up with new interactions even better.</p>

<p>The other one is the animation between page transitions or other interactions in the apps. Expression Blend is such a wonderful tool and animation is so easy there. I need more of that.</p>

<h2>Best Windows Phone App award</h2>

<p>This one is for Microsoft. They have a cash. They have a yearly developer conference. For the love of god, take a page from Apple book and copy their app awards at WWDC. Each year on your developer conference you need to do app awards too. Give out prizes. Recognize the best designed apps for Windows Phone and Windows 8. Recognize the developers and help community. Give them prominent place on the event site, maybe mentioned them in the keynote on day one! Announce these apps to your developers, so they know what the direction is going forward and what is the quality bar for apps. Raise the bar for everyone! It would do more good than coming up weird technology demos showcasing features of unreleased technology.</p>

<p>Ok, this post turned out to be more of a rant, where my Windows Phone user side addressing the Windows Phone developer side in me, but I think they are points and I am going to follow them!</p>

    <link href="http://gyurisc.github.io/blog/2012/12/20/keyboard-shortcuts-for-windows-8/"/>

    <id>http://gyurisc.github.io/blog/2012/12/20/keyboard-shortcuts-for-windows-8</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I released my first app for Windows 8! Now you can download <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/keyboard-shortcuts/a098e87b-cbeb-49ad-a356-c19b4c025afb">Keyboard Shortcuts App</a> from the Windows Store for Free.</p>

<p>As you might guessed, I am quite a bit of fan of productivity and doing things fast and swift on my computers. One of the main driver of productivity on a desktop computer are keyboard shortcuts. With Windows 8, it is even more so! I believe <a href="http://www.littlebigtomatoes.com/2012/12/keyboard-shortcut-starter-kit-for-windows-8/">keyboard shortcuts</a> on Windows 8 are essential to be productive.</p>

<!--more-->


<p></p>

<p>To help myself and hopefully others to memorize these shortcuts I created an app that makes easy to find and learn the shortcuts. Currently, it contains about 100 shortcuts for Windows 8, Calendar and Mail. I am hoping to add more shortcuts and other applications soon.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback, issues or you think there is something missing just ping me on twitter. I would be happy to help you!</p>

    <link href="http://gyurisc.github.io/blog/2012/11/27/emailme-for-windows-phone-7/"/>

    <id>http://gyurisc.github.io/blog/2012/11/27/emailme-for-windows-phone-7</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post was written by me about two months ago, then I forgot about it. I decided to publish it regardless. This app did not really live up to the plans downloadwise, but I am still happy with it. I plan to write a follow up and discuss what I learnt from it marketing and business wise!</em></p>

<p>In the last three-four months I worked on my first app called <a href="http://hotbidd.com/apps/wp7/emailme/">EmailMe</a>, while commuting and now it is available on the marketplace for 0.99.</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>Download <a href="http://hotbidd.com/apps/wp7/emailme/">EmailMe</a> from the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/emailme/109144f2-8629-42fd-99d9-9e0ce7ec1cc1">Marketplace</a></li>
</ul>


<p>With this app I had two goals. I wanted to make something that would fit my need and would use daily and I wanted to make something really polished
and nice looking. I think I achieved both of these goals. I like how the app looks and I use it every day several time.</p>

<p>EmailMe is a simple app that let&rsquo;s you to create messages and send them to yourself.</p>

<p>Why would anyone send messages to themselves? Isn&rsquo;t it just a littlebit weird? Let me explain.</p>

<p>I switched from Android app about a year ago when I received my belowed Lumia 800. On the Android phone I had several apps I relied on like the Kindle app, Audible or Google Listen. I had a Kindle client on Windows Phone 7 on day one and the phone is very great doing pdocast. Audible app now is finally available as well.</p>

<p>I also was a big user of the EEBA can help website. It is a finanacial website that let&rsquo;s you to implement a budget system and enter your spendings. It has a great iPhone and Android client that syncs flawlesly with the website. When, I contacted them and asked them if there is a cleint for Windows Phone 7 they politely told me that they do not have one and not planning to create one in the near future.</p>

<p>So I started to send email messages to myself to record what I spent money on the day nad entered these records at the evening into the EEBA site. Creating 5-10 meail messages on the phone was kind of repeptitve and clumsy. Over and over I had to enter the first few letters of my email. Provide a subject line and hit send button.</p>

<p>So I envisioned an app that would be helping me to send email where I do not need to enter email addresses over and over and I do not need to fill the subject line.</p>

<p>The app would fast to start, I would type in my message and hit send. No more worries about addresses and subject lines. The message would act as the subject line - truncated over certain length - and the message as well.</p>

<p>I put together a quick and dirty prototype and started using it. While using, I ironed out the bugs and starting to add features that I have missed.</p>

<p>Since then I gave up EEBA and switched to use YNAB which is awesome! Unfortunately no client for the wp7 platform yet. But I use my app everyday to post my spending records and notes. This workflow where I use my inbox as container for action items works for me very well as I clean out my inbox every day. Spending records are going to YNAB and notes or todos are going to todo application.</p>

<p>I also spent lot of time to polish the app. I added handling multiple email addresses. History for previous messages. I made sure that the app looks nice, bright and clean. The text is well readable even to me! :)</p>

<p>I also added a feature where I can learn how much I used the phone. How much messages I sent and the total time! The feature did not make too much sense, but I enjoyed implementing it.</p>

<p>All in all it was very enjoyable and fun time to implement the app and I learned a lot about the technology! It was a nice first step&hellip; now on to the next app!</p>
