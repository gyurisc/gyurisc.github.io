    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems I am unable to count to 5. In my last blog <a href="http://www.littlebigtomatoes.com/2013/01/5-ways-to-get-better-at-designing-apps-for-windows-phone/">5 ways to get better at designing apps for Windows Phone</a> I promised 5 ways and I delivered only four. This is the follow up, where I try to give one last piece of advice.</p>

<h2>Write apps for yourself</h2>

<p>You need to scratch your own itch. You need to solve your own existing problem, so find something you truly miss from your phone and then solve it! This way you will have an app that make your life better. Also, you will use this app every single day, so bugs and problems with your app surface much quicker and it will be easier to fix them as you are the one, who designed and coded it. But be very careful&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Do not write apps that no one will use&hellip;</h2>

<p>I am guilty as charged. I had this idea of <a href="www.hotbidd.com/apps/emailme">sending emails to myself</a> and wrote the app. It took me three months of hard work and when I finally released it, there were only a few downloads. This is not the end of the world, because I use the app myself several times a day and learned lot of stuff, while designing and coding it! But when I started to promote my app, no-one seemed to understand what problem of theirs that my app will help to solve.</p>

<p>I found a solution to a problem, that seemingly no other person on earth had. Frustrating, but the key lesson I learned is this - similar to designing your app - you should start promoting your app, before you start coding it! Go out and explain the idea behind your app and the problem it tries to solve. Find out that others are having this problem too and pitch your app to them. Embrace the feedback and in the end you will have a much better app. Learn from my mistake and do not create your app in vacuum&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am constantly trying to improve the quality of apps that I am publishing on the market for Windows Phone and Windows 8 or to other platforms in the future. In the last couple of days I try to think ways how I can get better at designing and creating apps. My primary device at the moment is a Lumia 800 and my primary desktop OS is Windows 8. These are not the dominant platforms yet, but I am hoping they get more popular over time.</p>

<h2>Buy an iPod Touch</h2>

<p> If you try to sense what is the golden standard of apps on today&rsquo;s prime platforms in terms of speed, design or popularity you really need something that you can try these apps on. Cheapest and best is to buy a used iPod Touch. This way you will feel what are the popular todo apps doing in the productivity category, if you are planning to write one for Windows Phone. Once you have the device, try as many apps as you can. Feel the speed and the attention to details that went into the app. Feel the love that went into the app. This is the quality you should aim for with your apps too!</p>

<p> For extra kudos buy a cheap android phone or tablet or both if you have the money. This is money well spent as you can start writing apps for those devices as well.</p>

<h2>Say no to the cookie cutter approach</h2>

<p> You have an app idea that will rock the world and make you rich. You need to move fast. Launch Visual Studio and quickly create a new project using the pivot app template. Code like crazy. Test, Test, Test and upload to the market place.</p>

<p> Just slow down for a second. This is how you create an app that does nothing to differentiate itself from the tens of thousands of other apps that are already on the marketplace. There must be a better way to differentiate it. Think about using different colors than the system accent color.</p>

<p>I know that the metro design guidelines are saying that we need to honor the user&rsquo;s choice of accent color and theme, but honestly as a user I need to puke when I see one more cookie cutter pivot style app that looks like all the other apps on my phone. I need opinionated apps! I need apps that stands out and they have personality!</p>

<h2>Animation, Animation, Animation</h2>

<p>Same here with the default controls. Pivot was great two years ago and remains very useful today, but now it feels a little tired to me. If you have an idea just to spice up a little the pivot the it is great. If you can come up with new interactions even better.</p>

<p>The other one is the animation between page transitions or other interactions in the apps. Expression Blend is such a wonderful tool and animation is so easy there. I need more of that.</p>

<h2>Best Windows Phone App award</h2>

<p>This one is for Microsoft. They have a cash. They have a yearly developer conference. For the love of god, take a page from Apple book and copy their app awards at WWDC. Each year on your developer conference you need to do app awards too. Give out prizes. Recognize the best designed apps for Windows Phone and Windows 8. Recognize the developers and help community. Give them prominent place on the event site, maybe mentioned them in the keynote on day one! Announce these apps to your developers, so they know what the direction is going forward and what is the quality bar for apps. Raise the bar for everyone! It would do more good than coming up weird technology demos showcasing features of unreleased technology.</p>

<p>Ok, this post turned out to be more of a rant, where my Windows Phone user side addressing the Windows Phone developer side in me, but I think they are points and I am going to follow them!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When looking at the latest and greatest apps on iOS, you might see things that are not really essential part of the app. They might not make sense at all! Like silly animation or stitches on the edge of the screen, corinthian leather or some old-age cassette player designed by Diether Someone. You might wonder why they wasted time all on these silly details, why not just put out the app and move to make the next one!</p>

<p>When I look at these apps, I see something different. With all these subtle touches and sweating the small details, these apps express craftmanship, pride, humbleness. These apps tell me the following:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Dear User,</p></p><p><p>We love you! We are humbled and greatly appreciate that you entrusted us with a piece of your attention and a little part of your life.</p></p><p><p>There is no task too small for us! We will handle all your request promptly, effortlessly and with a beaming smile on our UI.</p></p><p><p>We do what you ask us to do and then disappear like we never existed. But that&rsquo;s okay! We exists to make you happier!</p></p><p><p>Regards,<br/>The Well Designed Apps<br/>PS: Oh and the stiched corinthian leather is there, because we think you deserve the best! Period!</p></blockquote></p>

    <id>http://www.littlebigtomatoes.com/2012/03/an-easy-way-to-create-awesome-looking-windows-phone7-icons-using-expression-design</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am always having problems when it comes to creating icons for my Wp7 apps.I am a coder and not a designer, so drawing something nice looking is really really out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>Previously I spent hours trying to draw symbols myself, but I never really liked the outcome. But lately, I found a quick and effective way to create nice looking icons for my Windows Phone 7 apps. Here it goes:</p>

<!--more-->


<p></p>

<h3>The Noun project</h3>

<p>First, I go to the <a href="http://thenounproject.com">nounproject</a> website to find some nice looking symbols. This website has hundreeds of symbols and you can download them for free in vector format. The graphics comes with a Creative Commons license, so you&rsquo;re free to do whatever you want with them. Sounds pretty neat, if you ask me!</p>

<p><img src="/images/000.png" title="&lsquo;thenounproject website&rsquo; &lsquo;The Noun Project a website a source for symbols in SVG format&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Once, you found the symbol you like, download and extract it. The symbol is in SVG format. I am using Expression Design for drawing my icons, but Design unfortunately does not support SVG yet. I need a tool that can convert SVG to something that I can import to Expression Design.</p>

<p><img src="/images/001_thumb.png" title="&lsquo;Choose a symbol from thenounproject site.&rsquo; &lsquo;Symbol from thenounproject website.&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Inkscape</h3>

<p>With Inkscape I can do exactly this. Inkscape can import SVG and can export .PDF and .PDF can be imported to Expression Design.Inkscape is a very cool, free and open source drawing application. You can download it from <a href="http://inkscape.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/002_thumb.png" title="&lsquo;Inkscape&rsquo; &lsquo;Download and install inkscape&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Once Inkscape is installed then you can import the .SVG file and save it as .PDF file. After that I change the  .PDF extension to .AI and now I can import into Expression Design.</p>

<p>First, import your svg file to Inkscape for converting to AI format:</p>

<p><img src="/images/003_thumb.png" title="&lsquo;Import your symbol to Inkscape&rsquo; &lsquo;Import your symbol to Inkscape&rsquo;" ></p>

<p><img src="/images/004_thumb.png" title="&lsquo;Symbol imported&rsquo; &lsquo;Symbol imported&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Then save the your symbol in PDF format. Make sure that PDF 1.4 is selected as PDF version:</p>

<p><img src="/images/005_thumb.png" title="&lsquo;Export your symbol in PDF format&rsquo; &lsquo;Export your symbol in PDF format&rsquo;" ></p>

<p><img src="/images/007_thumb.png" title="&lsquo;Setting the correct PDF version&rsquo; &lsquo;Setting the correct PDF version to PDF 1.4&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Expression Design</h3>

<p>Before importing to Expression Design rename the exported .pdf to  .ai. This way Expression Design can export your artwork as an Adobe Illustrator file.</p>

<p><img src="/images/009_thumb.png" title="&lsquo;Import your artwork to Expression Design&rsquo; &lsquo;Import your artwork to Expression Design&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Here in Expression Design I can re-use my icon design template to create all the different sizes of icons that are needed for my WP7 app and export them to .PNG format to embedd in your WP7 Application project.</p>

<p><img src="/images/010_thumb.png" title="&lsquo;Your artwork now imported to Expression Design&rsquo; &lsquo;Your artwork now imported to Expression Design&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>You can also change the shape as it is vector based to alter the shape!</p>

<p><img src="/images/011_thumb.png" title="&lsquo;Vector shapes in Expression Design&rsquo; &lsquo;Vector shapes in Expression Design&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<p>If you would like to have this artwork in your silverlight, wpf or your windows phone app, you can also create a xaml file out of it in Expression Blend importing the .ai file and converting it to xaml.</p>

<p><img src="/images/014_thumb.png" title="&lsquo;Artwork imported to Expression Blend&rsquo; &lsquo;Artwork imported to Expression Blend&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
